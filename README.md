# Mosaic-Generator - Python Scripts
A collection of python scripts that take an image and a directory of images as input and generate a mosaic out of it
<br><br>
Note: similar.py script is not a mosaic generator script. Instead, it's a script that takes two pictures as input and returns a number indicating how similar the images are - used this to determine the accuracy of the mosaics
