DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING (DP):

In this context, "Programming" refers to a tabular method.

The idea is to solve problems by combining solutions to subproblems. 
Unlike divide and conquer methods, however, DP algorithms solve each subproblem only once - avoiding the work of recomputation of an answer each time a sub problem is solved.



Steps:
0. Identify optimal substructures
1. Define an array
2. Write a recurrence relation that defines elements of array in terms of other elements of the array
3. Write algorithm to fill this array
4. Show how the array can be used to solve the particular problem
4. Analyze run time
