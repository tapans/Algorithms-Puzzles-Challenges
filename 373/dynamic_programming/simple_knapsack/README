The Simple Knapsack problem is the following:

You have a knapsack with capacity k and want to choose a collection of items to take in the knapsack such that the weight of the items does not exceed capacity k, and the total weight of all the weights is maximal

Input: weights w_1, ... , w_n (- N and knapsack capacity k (- N

Problem: Find S (_ {1,...,n} such that 
    weight(S) <= k and weight(S) is maximal

Solve using Dynamic Programming.
