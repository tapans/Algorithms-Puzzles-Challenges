The rod cutting problem is the following:

Given a rod of length n inches and a 
table of prices P_i for i (- 1,2,..,n
Determine the maximum revenue R_n obtainable 
by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces. 
Note that if the price P_n for a rod 
of length n is large enough, an optimal solution may require no cutting at all
.
